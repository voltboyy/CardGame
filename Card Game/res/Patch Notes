Game name set to: "Card Game"
Basic client and server added
Little orb moving game made in standalone for further testing
After a long time of firewall adjusting and port forwarding, finally got connection to work over Internet
Added two different circles, one for client coordinates and one for server, meant for debugging
Bug: Once client fails to update another players coordinates, it stops updating its own and gets far behind => disconnects
	If you keep on moving after this bug occurs your character freezes
	Possible bugfix: putting a delay between updates serverside
Added connect button, messagebox and closeButton
