Game name set to: "Card Game"
Basic client and server added
Little orb moving game made in standalone for further testing
After a long time of firewall adjusting and port forwarding, finally got connection to work over Internet
Added two different circles, one for client coordinates and one for server, meant for debugging
Bug: Once client fails to update another players coordinates, it stops updating its own and gets far behind => disconnects
	If you keep on moving after this bug occurs your character freezes
	Possible bugfix: putting a delay between updates serverside
Added connect button, messagebox and closeButton

---v1.05---
Massive update on client and server
Input boxes have been coded and are working
Logging in with registered username and password is possible now
Password is encrypted together with salt to ensure safety
Entered password is "forgotten" once you try connecting, all for safety
Username can only exist out of letters and numbers
Password can exist out of most characters but the special characters aren't really working yet with qwerty
Updating bug has been fixed by delaying updates client side, this might have to be applied serverside
Playerid's are correctly opened up again when somebody disconnects
